                <h3>Aspiring UI/UX Designer</h3>
            <p>Hey there! I'm on the path to becoming a UI/UX Designer, which basically means I'm all about making websites and apps look awesome and easy to use. 
                Right now, I'm cruising through my third year as a student at <strong>Iloilo Science and Technology University Miagao Campus,</strong> studying the ins and outs of <strong>Information Technology</strong>.
                In class, I'm tackling everything from coding and software development to figuring out how to make information systems tick. It's been a wild ride, but I'm loving the chance to learn and get hands-on with all things tech.
                I'm not just about the techie stuff, thoughâ€”I've got a creative side too. Designing user interfaces and experiences is my jam, and I'm pumped to bring a fresh perspective to the digital world. So, if you're into making websites look cool and work even cooler, you're speaking my language! Can't wait to turn all this learning into some real-deal projects that make a splash online. Let's do this! ðŸš€</p>
